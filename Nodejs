Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)
Frontend is the visible part of a web application that users interact with directly.
User Interface:
Frontend is responsible for designing and displaying the UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes layouts, buttons, forms, colors, and responsiveness so the application looks good on all devices.
User Interaction:
It handles user actions such as clicks, typing, scrolling, and form submissions. JavaScript ensures smooth interaction, validations, and dynamic updates without reloading the page.
Communication with Backend:
Frontend sends requests to the backend (via APIs) and displays the received data to the user. It acts as a bridge between users and server logic.

Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
Backend is the engine of a web application, working behind the scenes.
Server-Side Processing:
It processes requests from the frontend, applies logic, and generates responses.
Database Handling:
Backend stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes data from databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
Security and Authentication:
It manages login, authorization, encryption, and ensures data privacy and secure access.

Q3. Business Logic
Business logic is the set of rules that define how an application works according to business requirements.
Examples:
1.	E-commerce: Applying discounts, tax calculation, and order validation.
2.	Banking App: Minimum balance checks and interest calculation.
3.	Air Quality System: Deciding pollution levels (Good, Moderate, Poor) based on sensor values.
Business logic ensures correctness, consistency, and fairness.

Q4. Client–Server Model
The Client–Server Model is a system where tasks are divided between requesters and providers.
Client: Browser or mobile app used by the user.
Server: A system that processes requests and sends responses.
Communication: Happens through HTTP/HTTPS using request–response cycles


Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture divides a web app into layers for clarity and scalability.
Presentation Layer: User interface (Frontend).
Application Layer: Business logic and processing (Backend).
Data Layer: Database and data storage.
Why used:
It improves maintainability, scalability, security, and teamwork.

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language
JavaScript is widely used on the backend due to its efficiency.
Performance:
Node.js uses non-blocking I/O, making it fast and scalable.
Ecosystem:
NPM offers thousands of libraries and tools.
Popular Frameworks:
Express.js, NestJS, and Fastify.
Using JavaScript on both frontend and backend simplifies development and improves productivity.
